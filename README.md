# WSD-Detection-in-shrimps
Shrimp WSD (White Spot Disease) detection using machine learning
Introduction-This project implements a deep learning model to automatically detect White Spot Disease (WSD) in shrimp images. Early detection is crucial for effective disease management in shrimp aquaculture.
Problem Addressed: Manual or laboratory-based WSD detection can be time-consuming, require expert knowledge, or be limited in scalability. This project seeks to address these limitations by leveraging the power of deep learning for automated image analysis.
